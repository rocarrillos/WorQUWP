# WorQUWP
Same idea as WorQ, but using the new Universal Windows Platform.

Did you see my other project, WorQ? I decided to try to make it as a Windows Universal first, partly
because UWP apps are way more modern and slick and partly because the documentation is way better.

If you didn't, the idea is that I'm tired of going to lab workstations and having to ask around if 
anyone is using it, or running something that shouldn't be killed, or whatever, then having to go back
to my own desk because the workstation is in use. I want to have a queue app that is easy to use and 
easy to check, first of all, so that there are no doubts about who is using the workstation, and I would 
like to have a functionality so that you can check the queue from your desk without having to get up and
waste time. Maybe I'll create a Linux port of this, but I decided on Windows since Windows is ubiquitous
in industry.
